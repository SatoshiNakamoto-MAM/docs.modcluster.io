  <para>The following are the steps to set up a minimal working installation
  of mod_cluster on a single httpd server and a single back end server, either
  JBoss AS, JBossWeb or Tomcat. The steps can be repeated to add as many httpd
  servers or back end servers to your cluster as is desired.</para>

  <para>The steps shown here are not intended to demonstrate how to set up a
  production install of mod_cluster; for example <link linkend="ssl.xml">using
  SSL to secure access</link> to the httpd-side mod_manager component is not
  covered. See the httpd-side and java-side configuration documentation for
  the full set of configuration options.</para>
